# Agricultural Automated Irrigation System

## Overview

The Agricultural Automated Irrigation System developed by Unmesh Phaterpekar is a cutting-edge solution designed to optimize irrigation by using moisture and nutrient sensors. This project, completed as part of ECEN 5613 Embedded System Design, aims to enhance plant growth, conserve water, and reduce nutrient waste by ensuring precise irrigation based on real-time soil conditions.

## Features

- **Moisture Sensing:** Ensures plants receive the exact amount of water needed, minimizing water wastage.
- **Nutrient Sensing:** Monitors essential nutrients in the soil, indicating when fertilization is needed.
- **Cost-Effective:** Reduces costs associated with water and fertilizers by optimizing their usage.
- **Environmental Sustainability:** Supports sustainable farming practices by reducing the environmental footprint of irrigation.

## Technical Description

The system's technical framework includes:
- **Board Design:** Utilizes STM32F411E-Discovery and Arduino UNO.
- **Sensor Integration:** Employs moisture sensors, NPK sensors, and a water level sensor interfaced using Modbus Protocol.
- **Firmware and Hardware Design:** Detailed designs for effective system operation and communication.
- **Testing Process:** Thorough testing to ensure reliability and efficiency in various environmental conditions.

## Installation

To set up the Agricultural Automated Irrigation System, follow the detailed steps outlined in the appendices of the project report which cover hardware setup, firmware installation, and sensor calibration.

## Usage

To operate the system:
1. Power up the system using the recommended configuration.
2. Ensure all sensors are correctly placed and connected.
3. Monitor the system's feedback through the terminal interface provided in the firmware.

## Future Development

Plans for future enhancements include:
- Integration of an LCD or OLED display for real-time monitoring.
- Addition of pH and temperature sensors to further optimize plant growth conditions.
- Implementation of a GSM module for remote monitoring and control.
